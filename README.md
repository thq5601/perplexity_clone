# Perflexity

Perflexity is a cross-platform AI-powered search and chat application inspired by Perplexity AI, built with Flutter for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Search:**  
  Enter any question or query and receive detailed, AI-generated answers with cited sources.

- **Web Search Integration:**  
  The backend fetches and processes relevant web results for your query, extracts content, and ranks sources by relevance using semantic similarity.

- **Cited Answers:**  
  Answers are generated by a large language model (Gemini 2.5) and cite the most relevant web sources.

- **Real-Time Chat:**  
  Communicate with the AI via a chat interface. The app uses WebSockets for real-time updates.

- **Modern UI:**  
  Clean, responsive interface with sidebars, search bar, and answer/source sections.

## How It Works

1. **User Query:**  
   Enter a question in the search bar and submit.

2. **Backend Processing:**  
   - The backend (FastAPI) receives the query.
   - Performs a web search using Tavily API.
   - Extracts and cleans content from the top results.
   - Ranks sources by semantic similarity to the query.
   - Passes the context and sources to the Gemini LLM to generate a detailed answer.

3. **Frontend Display:**  
   - Shows the answer and a list of cited sources.
   - Updates in real-time as the answer is generated.
